## What is Claw UI?

Claw UI is a modern web interface for OpenClaw that allows you to:

- **Chat with your AI agent** through an intuitive web interface
- **Connect multiple agents** from different devices
- **Access from anywhere** - no need to be on the same network
- **Secure cloud relay** - your conversations are routed through authenticated channels
- **Multi-session support** - manage multiple conversations simultaneously

## First Time Setup

### 1. Create Your Account

1. Navigate to the Claw UI URL (e.g., `https://claw-ui.yourdomain.com`)
2. Click **"Sign Up"** or **"Register"**
3. Enter your email address and create a password
4. Verify your email (if email verification is enabled)
5. Log in with your credentials

### 2. Initial Configuration

After logging in for the first time, you'll see the welcome screen. You have two options:

- **Run Setup Wizard** (recommended) - guided setup process
- **Manual Setup** - configure agents yourself

We recommend using the Setup Wizard for your first agent.

## Connecting Your First Agent

### Using the Setup Wizard

1. Click **"Run Setup Wizard"** from the home screen
2. The wizard will guide you through:
   - **Step 1: Name Your Agent** - Give your agent a memorable name (e.g., "Home Desktop", "Work Laptop")
   - **Step 2: Generate Token** - Click to create a secure authentication token
   - **Step 3: Install on Device** - Follow the instructions to install the OpenClaw plugin
   - **Step 4: Verify Connection** - Confirm your agent is connected

3. Copy the installation command and run it on your OpenClaw instance:

```bash
# Example installation command (generated by wizard)
openclaw plugin install claw-ui-cloud
openclaw config set claw-ui.relay-url "wss://relay.yourdomain.com"
openclaw config set claw-ui.auth-token "your-generated-token"
openclaw plugin enable claw-ui-cloud
```

4. Once connected, you'll see a green "online" status indicator

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Navigate to **Agents** → **Add Agent**
2. Enter a name for your agent
3. Copy the generated token
4. Configure your OpenClaw instance with the token and relay URL
5. Restart OpenClaw or reload the plugin

### Connection Troubleshooting

If your agent shows as offline:

1. **Check OpenClaw is running** on the device
2. **Verify plugin is enabled**: `openclaw plugin list`
3. **Check token**: Ensure auth token matches
